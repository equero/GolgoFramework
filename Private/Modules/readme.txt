Modules folder is for pre-build plugins for GolgoFramework.
The idea for this is to work like WordPress plugins.
 Although this folder can be used to extend your own functionallity or build your custom app as there is actually no need or restriction
 to use the App folder, App folder is created just because people are used to use that folder.
