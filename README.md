# GolgoFramework
This is my own framework started from scratch. 
Its hard to explain why use what i use...deal with it :), i will try to make a wiki or doc explaining how to use this, but without modules the framework is more or less easy to use.
What are modules? modules go into Modules folder (really?) and is an approach to WP plugin style but with php and not so clean...i am working on this.

Features:
[TODO]
